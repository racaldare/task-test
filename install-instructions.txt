Note: This instruction was tested on a fresh Ubuntu.
If something does not work for you, please do not hesitate to contact me, I will be extremely happy to help! :)
Step 1: Get a new ubuntu OS.
Step 2: Install curl.
    a) sudo apt install curl
Step 3: Install current stable node version (20.10)
    a) cd ~
    b) curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
    c) sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
    d) sudo apt install nodejs
    e) Check node version: node -v (should be 20 something)
    f) Check npm version: npm --version (should be 10.2.x)
    g) Install typescript globally: npm install -g typescript
    h) Install all packages (just in case) for both applications at root level (look for package.json)
        a) npm install
    i) Build both projects at the root level (same as previous)
        a) tsc

Both applocations should now be working
To start them, just enter the following commands accordingly (in the root folder of each app)
1) npm run app
2) npm run server

....

In case things go WRONG (especialy with Unix socket and the file):
After Ubuntu boots for first time, nodejs and net package just refuses to run an Unix socket. <reinstalling ubuntu also takes long to test :(> 
Please, try restarting the computer (that helped me).
If not, I will gladly help with this issue as this solution has been developed on Linux latest stable version.
